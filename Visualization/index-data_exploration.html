    <h1>Overall Findings of Data Exploration</h1>
    <h2>The dataset is highly imbalanced, for both target and features</h2>
    <p style="font-size:small">Particularly within the Leadership sub-dataframe, the dataset was highly imbalanaced. For the target feature, 'Attrition', the Leadership sub-dataframe was the most imbalanced.  This imbalanced 
      has implications on the specific model approach we used for our machine learning assessment.  In addition to the target feature, the feature distribution was also highly variable.  For example, those in the Leadership 
      JobCategory were often older and paid more.  This further complicates building a successful machine learning model for the Leadership JobCategory.</p>

    <h2>Data correlation is relatively even and, for the most part, was not surprising</h2>
    <p style="font-size:small">We saw many positive correlations that were expected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size:12px">Age had a positive correlation to TotalWorkingYears, MonthlyIncome, JobLevel 
          <p style="font-style: italic">Possible Explination: The older you are, the longer you have been in the workforce, so the higher the income and job level</p></li>
        <li style="font-size:12px">MontlyIncome had a positive correlation to YearsAtCompany, TotalWorkingYears
          <p style="font-style: italic">Possible Explination: The longer you've stayed at the company and the longer you've been in the workforce, the more skills and 'investment' the company has in you and thus the higher your income</p></li>
        <li style="font-size:12px">PerformanceRating had a positive correlation to PercentSalaryHike
          <p style="font-style: italic">Possible Explination: The better you perform, the more valueable you become to the company and the more they are willing to pay you to stay</p></li>
        <li style="font-size:12px">JobLevel had a positive correlation to YearsAtCompany, TotalWorkingYears, MonthlyIncome
          <p style="font-style: italic">Possible Explination: The longer you've worked at the company and/or the more years you've had in the workforce, the more experience you have and the more they pay you for that experience</p></li>
      </ul>
    <p style="font-size:small">We saw one main negative correlation that was also expected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size:12px">JobCatebory had a negative correlation to JobLevel, MonthlyIncome, TotalWorkingYears
          <p style="font-style: italic">Possible Explination: Leadership (encoded value of 0) tends to be a higher level in a company and tends to be employees with a higher level of work experience, and is therefore paid more</p></li>
      </ul>
    <p style="font-size:small">We saw one correlation that was unexpected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size:12px">MaritialStatus had a negative correlation with StockOptionLevel
          <p style="font-style: italic">Possible Explination: Although additional data is needed, single employees (encoded value of 2) tend to be younger and, using the correlations noted above, tend to be lower in level.  Older employees, 
          however, are married (encoded value of 1) and even older still either remain married or divorced (encoded value of 0).</p></li>

    <h1>How Did We Conduct Data Exploration?</h1>
    <h2>Explore the imbalance of the target in the dataset</h2>
    <p style="font-size:small">Before building models, we needed to look at how the target feature, 'Attrition', was baanced throughout the main dataframe as well as the three sub-dataframes for each of the job categories.</p>

    <h2>Explore the correlation between different features</h2>
    <p style="font-size:small">To support feature analysis, we looked at correlation among each of the features for the main dataframe.  Using the output of this information we were able to combine some of the features.  An 
      additional benefit of this analysis is that we were able to identify interesting relationships between features that drove additional analysis and exploration.</p>
  
    <h2>Explore the distribution of different features</h2>
    <p style="font-size:small">A key part of successful model development and feature analysis is the distribution of those features.  Feature distribution gives us insight into how and/or why or model may not be as accurate.</p>

    <h2>Explore the distribution of features to one another</h2>
    <p style="font-size:small">As with the feature distribution, comparing the feature distribution to one another will provide similar benefits. Additionally, it will provide insights into the the overall workforce and our 
    secondary topics and questions.</p>

       <h1>Feature Distribution Analysis</h1>
        <p>Similarly to the MonthlyIncome, Age, and TotalWorkingYears distribution charts above that are skewed left, we also dug further into Age, 
          YearsInCurrentRole, and MonthlyRate. As you can see from the distribution graphs below, the leadership role tends to skew more to the right 
          than the other job categories. This is not completely surprising, as leaders tend to be more senior.</p>
        <p id="description" style="font-size: small; font-style: italic;">Age distribution looks relatively normal for each of the JobCategories.  Of note, however, the 
          Leadership category tends to skew more to the right and is not as evently distributed as the other categories.  This is not surprisng given
          leaders tend to be older, and it also compliments the correlation data we found.</p>

      <h1>Comparitive Feature Distribution Analysis</h1>
        <p>We conducted analysis on feature distribution relative to other features, and found distribution relative to one another for the most part expected.  There were, however, a few interesting findings in the data for a few comparisons: 
          StockOptionLevel to Maritial Status, JobLvel vs. Maritial Status, and JobCategory vs. Work Life Balance.  The findings here provide insight into some potential areas for programs that could benefit retetion, depending upon the outcome
          the feature analysis.</p>
        <p id="description2" style="font-size: small; font-style: italic;">As identified in our correlation matrix, there is a negative relationship between maritial status and stock option level, namely that married individuals tend to have higher
        stock option levels.  A potential explaination for this is that generally married individuals tend to be older and thus more senior.  Of note in this graph, however, those with a stock option level of 3 are all divorced.  Additional research
        should be completed in this area to look at those indivdiuals job levels, job categories, and work life balance to look for trends.</p>
